Practice problems for JavaScript focusing on array iterator methods. 

How to Complete:
 clone down the repo. all problems will be solved by console logging the expected data. no testing. run all your code inside the file that the prompts are in. Here's a very loose order, starting with the easiest to the hardest (totally subjective): 
 
 easy:
 - broncos
 - concerts
 
 med: 
 - drag race
 - orders
 - denver cafes
 - smash bros
 - murder she wrote
 - tyler, the creator
 
 hard:
 - care bears
 - fourteeners (xxxxtra hard)
 - strong bad
 - computers
 - fast and furious
 
 Fast and furious depends on tyler the creator being done so do those in order. other than that theyre all independent of each other
